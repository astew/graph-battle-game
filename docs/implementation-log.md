# Implementation Log

| Date (UTC) | Scope | Details | Went Well | Needs Attention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-17 | P2.A – Reinforcements | Added reinforcement evaluator/allocation service, wired it into the GameEngine end-turn flow, emitted events, and exposed preview data through `getView()`. | Reinforcements now award deterministic strength boosts to border nodes with full test coverage for edge cases. | UI still needs to visualize reinforcement summaries and support placement overlays per plan P2.C. |
| 2025-11-17 | P2.C – Interaction flow | Added attack-selection wizard, reinforcement overlays, keyboard shortcuts, and an animated event log to the UI, plus SSR tests covering the log update story. | Manual play now supports click/keyboard-driven attacks with clear guidance and post-turn reinforcement summaries. | Bots and reinforcement allocation automation remain to be implemented in later milestones. |
| 2025-11-16 | P2.B – Attack mechanics & combat | Added the attack action, resolver, and `ATTACK_RESOLVED` events with deterministic RNG plus tests for win/loss cases. | Core combat now mutates board ownership/strength correctly and surfaces round data to observers. | Reinforcement payouts and UI attack controls remain outstanding before the game is fully playable. |
| 2025-11-16 | P2.A/P2.C – Standard board + menu | Added the StandardBoardGenerator with 6×8 carving, enforced five-player starts, node coordinates, and UI updates for the title screen plus SVG grid rendering. | Engine now exports connected boards with balanced ownership and the UI visualizes edges + node strengths. | Need to wire interaction inputs and reinforcements before the game is fully playable. |
| 2025-11-16 | P1.A – Core domain & engine skeleton | Established domain entities, deterministic RNG, empty board generator, and turn-only GameEngine with event bus plus unit tests and build script fix. | Tests now cover domain validation, RNG determinism, board generator output, and engine turn rotation. | Player defaults/colors are simplistic and may need revisiting once UI consumes the state. |
| 2025-11-16 | P1.B – UI bootstrap | Hooked the React shell to the core engine, rendering seeded players, board nodes, and an end-turn action with updated styling plus SSR tests validating the output. | We now have a visible surface that exercises the engine view and gives us space to iterate on UX. | Need to expand beyond empty boards and eventually wire actual command inputs + events. |
| 2025-11-16 | P1.C – Bots & simulator parity | Repaired the placeholder bot context and simulator CLI to align with the new core exports, restoring the failing workspace tests. | Deterministic snapshots and color constants are now consistent across packages. | The bot snapshots are still extremely barebones and will need richer data once combat logic exists. |
