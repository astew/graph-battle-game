# Implementation Log

| Date (UTC) | Scope | Details | Went Well | Needs Attention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-16 | P2.B – Attack mechanics & combat | Added the attack action, resolver, and `ATTACK_RESOLVED` events with deterministic RNG plus tests for win/loss cases. | Core combat now mutates board ownership/strength correctly and surfaces round data to observers. | Reinforcement payouts and UI attack controls remain outstanding before the game is fully playable. |
| 2025-11-16 | P2.A/P2.C – Standard board + menu | Added the StandardBoardGenerator with 6×8 carving, enforced five-player starts, node coordinates, and UI updates for the title screen plus SVG grid rendering. | Engine now exports connected boards with balanced ownership and the UI visualizes edges + node strengths. | Need to wire interaction inputs and reinforcements before the game is fully playable. |
| 2025-11-16 | P1.A – Core domain & engine skeleton | Established domain entities, deterministic RNG, empty board generator, and turn-only GameEngine with event bus plus unit tests and build script fix. | Tests now cover domain validation, RNG determinism, board generator output, and engine turn rotation. | Player defaults/colors are simplistic and may need revisiting once UI consumes the state. |
| 2025-11-16 | P1.B – UI bootstrap | Hooked the React shell to the core engine, rendering seeded players, board nodes, and an end-turn action with updated styling plus SSR tests validating the output. | We now have a visible surface that exercises the engine view and gives us space to iterate on UX. | Need to expand beyond empty boards and eventually wire actual command inputs + events. |
| 2025-11-16 | P1.C – Bots & simulator parity | Repaired the placeholder bot context and simulator CLI to align with the new core exports, restoring the failing workspace tests. | Deterministic snapshots and color constants are now consistent across packages. | The bot snapshots are still extremely barebones and will need richer data once combat logic exists. |
