# @graph-battle/bots

This package will host a catalog of AI player policies for Graph Battle. Policies wrap the core engine and decide what moves a computer-controlled player should make.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` – copies the source files into the `dist/` directory.
- `npm test` – executes the unit tests with Node's built-in test runner.

## Status

Only a placeholder "do nothing" bot exists today. Future work will add real policies and supporting utilities.
