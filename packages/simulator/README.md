# @graph-battle/simulator

The simulator package will orchestrate automated matches between different bot policies. It will eventually power large-scale experiments and batch analyses.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` – copies the source files into the `dist/` directory and exposes the CLI entry point.
- `npm test` – runs the unit tests using Node's built-in test runner.

## Status

The current implementation only exposes scaffolding utilities and a stub CLI command.
